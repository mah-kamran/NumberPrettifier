# NumberPrettifier
This project gets a double value as input and pretifies it per million, billion or trillion

#assumptions: 
1.number could only be positive (for simplicity)
2.if number is larger than trillion order, the function returns null

#approach: adopted regular expression to have pretified version of numbers
